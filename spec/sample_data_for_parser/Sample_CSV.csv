Most of our clients are political campaigns, including candidates, issues, and advocacy groups of all different parties and persuasions. With Impact Dialing, they can upload lists of voters to call, have their volunteers log on to our web-based system, and let our computers do the dialing. Instead of wasting their volunteers' time with printing out lists, dialing numbers by hand, recording results with pen and paper, and manually entering them back into the computer, their volunteers can use their time more efficiently and talk to far more voters by using Impact Dialing.",Interns will work on our Rails app that administrators use to manage their callers and campaigns.

As pioneer of the Relationship Coffee Model, we’ve led the paradigm shift that has served as the foundation for the direct trade model and the interest in creating a closer connection between farmers and consumers.","The interns will support one of several projects we currently have, either for Sustainable Harvest or our sister non-profiit organization, Relationship Coffee Institute. The projects, written in Rails (3 and 4) and using Postgres. The interns will primarily be looking for and fixing bugs in the existing framework and expanding the basic functionality of the applications. Interns would also be improving the current UI through CSS and HTML.","An ideal intern would be confident using Ruby, Rails, SQL, CSS (Bootstrap), HTML, and Git. An ideal candidate would have interest in being a generalist and working with a wide variety of tools, languages, and frameworks, rather than becoming an expert in a narrow skill set. They would be capable of communicating well with both technical and non-technical co-workers. Proficiency in Spanish would also be ideal, but is not required. An ideal intern would be capable of working independently  or collaboratively on a variety of projects.  Also, a love of all things coffee would certainly be ideal!",,Scott Dudley,,,,http://www.sustainableharvest.com/,2,,,,,,,
3/6/2015 17:25:32,"Workfrom, Inc.",n/a,Jewel Mlnarik,,,No,,"We connect international communities of mobile workers & business travelers, giving them an easy way to find and share great workspaces -- from coffee shops, cafes, bars, libraries to other shared spaces. At the core of this is our website: https://workfrom.co which runs largely on Wordpress.",Wordpress based development -- likely a combination of both the back and front-end (Javascript/CSS/PHP) --  adding new features to Workfrom.co and creating landing pages in support of marketing initiatives. ,"First and foremost, you need to love high fives. It's a daily practice, along with a core respect for people of all varieties. Inclusion is our default and communication is key. We all make mistakes and we always strive to do better, making certain to celebrate all the small wins we can along the way.

We host weekly meetups - every Wednesday & Friday - when we have the opportunity to work in the same space. Outside of that, we work from our homes and coffee shops of choice. We also have access to coworking spaces in town and could setup ""office hours"" for an additional day each week. You will need to be self-directing and able to work remotely. (Don't worry, we have plenty of tools and tricks for staying connected when not sharing a physical space!)

The history of our code base is one of ""do what we can now and improve later"" ... so it's less than perfect and the ideal intern won't sweat unfamiliar territory. You needn't be a master coder and you enjoy a good hunt. 

If you're coming out of the PHP/JavaScript/Drupal series, you'll have the technical chops for the job. If you've worked with Wordpress before -- bonus! But it's not required if you've worked with Drupal as many of the core concepts are easily transferable. 

** A note from Maureen: I talked with Jewel at WorkFrom and they know they will be working with folks from the Ruby/JS/Rails class. She'll be able to shift intern tasks more towards front end & JavaScript, or side projects that can be built in other languages. But if you want to dive into PHP and WordPress the option will be there!",,,,,,https://workfrom.co,2,,,,,,,
